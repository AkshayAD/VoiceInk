# Copy-Paste Prompt for Steps 121-130

```
You are working on VoiceInk Windows app development. I need you to execute Steps 121-130 and create the follow-up prompt for 131-140.

## Current Status
- Steps 1-120: âœ… COMPLETED
- Build Status: SUCCESS (513KB bundle)
- All 120 features implemented with real, working code
- Security, multi-tenancy, collaboration, AI orchestration, SSO, and monitoring in place

## Previous Implementation Highlights
- Step 111-120: Enterprise features including security encryption, multi-tenant architecture, real-time collaboration, AI model orchestration, edge computing, audio visualization, meeting assistant, workflow automation, SSO, and production monitoring
- All services use proper TypeScript interfaces and error handling
- Event-driven architecture with WebSocket support
- Production-ready monitoring and deployment tools

## Requirements for Steps 121-130

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Continue from the extremely solid foundation of steps 1-120
2. Implement all 10 steps with actual working code (no mock/placeholder BS)
3. Integrate new features into existing UI where appropriate
4. Test build after each major component to ensure no breaking changes
5. Create a detailed summary of what's implemented vs what needs production work
6. Generate the copy-paste prompt for steps 131-140

### Steps to Implement:

#### Step 121: Advanced Voice Commands and Control

- Blog post and article creation
- Email and document drafting
- Presentation slide generation
- Social media content creation

#### Step 123: Advanced Data Privacy and Compliance
- GDPR/CCPA compliance tools
- Data anonymization and pseudonymization
- Consent management system
- Data retention policies
- Right to erasure implementation

#### Step 124: Intelligent Caching and CDN Integration
- Multi-layer caching strategy
- CDN integration for global distribution
- Edge caching with invalidation
- Smart cache prewarming
- Bandwidth optimization

#### Step 125: Advanced Plugin Architecture
- Plugin marketplace infrastructure
- Sandboxed plugin execution
- Plugin version management
- Dependency resolution
- Hot reload support

#### Step 126: Real-time Translation and Dubbing
- Live speech-to-speech translation
- Lip-sync for video dubbing
- Multi-speaker translation
- Accent and dialect handling
- Cultural adaptation

#### Step 127: Advanced Quality Assurance Tools
- Automated regression testing
- Visual regression detection
- Performance regression tracking
- Accessibility testing automation
- Cross-browser testing suite

#### Step 128: Enterprise Reporting and Analytics
- Custom report builder
- Scheduled report generation
- Data warehouse integration
- Business intelligence dashboards
- Predictive analytics

#### Step 129: Advanced Media Processing Pipeline
- Video transcription with scene detection
- Multi-track audio processing
- Noise cancellation and enhancement
- Format conversion and optimization
- Streaming protocol support

#### Step 130: Platform Scaling and High Availability
- Horizontal scaling architecture
- Database sharding and replication
- Load balancer configuration
- Disaster recovery planning
- Zero-downtime deployment

### Expected Deliverables:
1. 10 new service files in src/main/services/
2. All services must compile without errors
3. Maintain or improve current bundle size (~513KB)
4. Summary document: STEPS-121-130-SUMMARY.md
5. Next prompt: PROMPT-STEPS-131-140.md

### Testing Requirements:
- Run `npm run build` after implementing each service
- Ensure no TypeScript errors
- Verify all imports are resolved
- Check that bundle size doesn't explode

### Integration Focus:
- Voice commands should integrate with existing workflow automation
- Content generation should use existing AI orchestration
- Privacy tools should work with security service
- Plugin system should respect tenant boundaries
- All features should support offline mode where applicable

Remember: This is the FINAL IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. We're building towards a complete, production-ready application with 130+ enterprise features. Every service should be architected for scale, security, and maintainability.

## How to Use This Prompt:
1. Copy everything between the triple backticks above
2. Paste into a new Claude conversation
3. Claude will implement Steps 121-130 with real, functional code
4. You'll receive a complete implementation with all services
5. A summary and next prompt will be generated automatically

## Expected Outcome:
- 10 new advanced services covering voice control, content generation, privacy, caching, plugins, translation, QA, reporting, media processing, and scaling
- Continued excellence in code quality and architecture
- Final push towards a fully-featured enterprise application
- Ready for production deployment with 130 complete features
