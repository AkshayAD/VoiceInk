# VoiceInk Windows - Reality Check & Follow-up Prompt

## üö® REALITY CHECK: What's ACTUALLY Implemented vs What's BS

### ‚úÖ ACTUALLY WORKING (Not BS)
1. **Electron App Structure** - Real, launches, has UI
2. **React UI Components** - 27+ components actually render
3. **SQLite Database with Prisma** - Works, migrations run
4. **IPC Communication** - Main/Renderer processes communicate
5. **Package Dependencies** - All installed, no conflicts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING (Half BS)
1. **Gemini Integration** 
   - ‚úÖ Service code exists and compiles
   - ‚ùå No API key = can't actually transcribe
   - ‚ùå Never tested with real audio
   
2. **Audio Recording**
   - ‚úÖ Browser Audio Recorder code exists
   - ‚ùå Not connected to UI buttons
   - ‚ùå Never saves actual audio files

3. **Database Operations**
   - ‚úÖ Schema exists, can insert records
   - ‚ùå No real data ever saved from app usage

### ‚ùå COMPLETE BS (Mock/Fake)
1. **WASAPI Audio** - Linux can't compile Windows headers
2. **Whisper.cpp** - No actual model files, binding won't compile
3. **Real Transcription** - Never transcribed a single audio file
4. **Power Mode** - Mock implementation only
5. **Speaker Diarization** - Code exists but never runs
6. **Export Features** - UI exists, functionality doesn't
7. **Settings Persistence** - Mock data only
8. **Update System** - No update server configured

## üìã IMMEDIATE REPAIRS NEEDED (Before ANY Progress)

1. **Fix Audio Recording Pipeline**
   ```typescript
   // src/renderer/pages/RecorderPage.tsx needs:
   - Connect record button to browserAudioRecorder.ts
   - Wire stop button to actually stop recording
   - Save audio blob to file system
   - Send audio data through IPC to main process
   ```

2. **Fix Gemini API Connection**
   ```typescript
   // Need to:
   - Add API key input in Settings page
   - Store API key securely in electron-store
   - Test with actual audio file
   - Handle API errors gracefully
   ```

3. **Fix Database Persistence**
   ```typescript
   // transcriptionRepository.ts needs:
   - Connect to actual transcription results
   - Save real audio file paths
   - Link transcriptions to recordings
   ```

## üöÄ NEXT 10 STEPS TO EXECUTE NOW

```bash
# COPY AND PASTE THIS ENTIRE SECTION TO CLAUDE

## CONTEXT
You are working on VoiceInk Windows, an Electron app for voice transcription. 
Current branch: terragon/migrate-app-to-windows
The app structure exists but most features are mocked. Gemini 2.5 models are configured but untested.

## YOUR IMMEDIATE TASKS (Steps 71-80)

### Step 71: Fix Audio Recording Connection
- Open src/renderer/pages/RecorderPage.tsx
- Import browserAudioRecorder from '../services/browserAudioRecorder'
- Connect handleStartRecording to browserAudioRecorder.startRecording()
- Connect handleStopRecording to browserAudioRecorder.stopRecording()
- Test that audio blob is created when recording stops

### Step 72: Implement Audio File Saving
- In browserAudioRecorder.ts, add saveAudioFile() method
- Use electron's dialog.showSaveDialog for file location
- Convert blob to Buffer and save with fs.writeFile
- Return file path for database storage

### Step 73: Wire IPC for Audio Processing
- In src/preload/index.ts, ensure audio.saveRecording is exposed
- In audioHandlers.ts, implement 'audio:save-recording' handler
- Connect recording completion to transcription pipeline
- Test IPC communication with console logs

### Step 74: Add Gemini API Key Management
- Create src/renderer/components/ApiKeyInput.tsx component
- Add to SettingsPage with secure input field
- Store in electron-store (install if needed: npm install electron-store)
- Load API key on app startup in geminiService.ts

### Step 75: Test Real Audio Transcription
- Create test audio file (record yourself saying "Testing Gemini transcription")
- Set GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
- Run test-gemini-2.0.js with actual audio
- Debug any errors that occur

### Step 76: Connect Transcription to Database
- In audioProcessingPipeline.ts, save transcription results
- Use transcriptionRepository.create() with real data
- Include audio file path, transcription text, timestamps
- Verify data appears in database with Prisma Studio

### Step 77: Fix History Page Display
- In src/renderer/pages/HistoryPage.tsx
- Implement loadTranscriptions() to fetch from database
- Display real transcriptions instead of mock data
- Add delete and export functionality

### Step 78: Implement Export Features
- Create exportService.ts in src/main/services
- Implement exportToJSON, exportToTXT, exportToCSV
- Add IPC handlers for export operations
- Connect to UI export buttons

### Step 79: Add Error Handling & Recovery
- Wrap all async operations in try-catch blocks
- Add user-friendly error toasts
- Implement retry logic for API failures
- Add offline mode detection

### Step 80: Create Integration Tests
- Write Playwright test for complete recording flow
- Test: Start recording ‚Üí Stop ‚Üí Transcribe ‚Üí Save ‚Üí View in History
- Create test-full-workflow.js
- Document any failures for next iteration

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS
After completing each step, run:
npm run build  # Ensure no TypeScript errors
npm run dev    # Test in development mode
```

## üìä STEPS 81-90 PLANNING (For Next Iteration)

```bash
# SAVE THIS FOR THE NEXT FOLLOW-UP

### Step 81: Implement Real-time Transcription
- Stream audio chunks to Gemini during recording
- Display partial transcriptions in UI
- Handle streaming API responses

### Step 82: Add Multi-language Support
- Implement language detection in Gemini prompt
- Add language selector in UI
- Store language preference per transcription

### Step 83: Implement Speaker Diarization
- Enable in Gemini API options
- Parse speaker segments from response
- Color-code speakers in UI display

### Step 84: Add Timestamp Navigation
- Parse timestamps from Gemini response
- Create clickable timestamp UI
- Implement audio playback at timestamp

### Step 85: Create Keyboard Shortcuts
- Global shortcut for start/stop recording
- Navigation shortcuts for history
- Export shortcuts (Ctrl+E, etc.)

### Step 86: Implement Settings Persistence
- Save all settings to electron-store
- Load settings on app startup
- Sync settings across windows

### Step 87: Add Audio Visualization
- Implement waveform display during recording
- Show audio levels in real-time
- Add spectrum analyzer component

### Step 88: Create Batch Processing
- Allow multiple file selection
- Queue files for transcription
- Show progress for batch operations

### Step 89: Implement Search Functionality
- Full-text search across transcriptions
- Filter by date, language, duration
- Highlight search terms in results

### Step 90: Production Build & Packaging
- Configure electron-builder properly
- Create Windows installer (.exe)
- Test installation on clean system
- Document installation process
```

## üîÑ RECURSIVE CONTINUATION PROMPT

```markdown
# COPY THIS FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT SESSION

I'm continuing work on VoiceInk Windows. Here's my status:

## Completed Steps
[List steps 71-80 or whatever you completed]

## Current Issues
[List any blockers or errors encountered]

## Next Tasks
Please:
1. First, verify what's ACTUALLY working vs mocked by running the app
2. Fix any broken implementations from previous steps
3. Execute steps [81-90] or [91-100] etc.
4. For each step, provide actual code changes, not just descriptions
5. Test each change before moving to the next
6. Create the next 10 steps planning for steps [91-100] or [101-110] etc.
7. Update this prompt template with new completed steps

Remember:
- Native WASAPI/Whisper.cpp won't work on Linux (use mocks)
- Gemini API needs valid key to test
- Always run `npm run build` to catch TypeScript errors
- Check git status frequently
- Don't create unnecessary files
```

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

You'll know the app is REALLY working when:
1. ‚úÖ Can record real audio from microphone
2. ‚úÖ Audio saves to actual file on disk
3. ‚úÖ Gemini transcribes the audio (with API key)
4. ‚úÖ Transcription saves to SQLite database
5. ‚úÖ History page shows real transcriptions
6. ‚úÖ Can export transcriptions to file
7. ‚úÖ Settings persist between app restarts
8. ‚úÖ No mock data anywhere in production flow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

1. **DON'T** trust file existence - many files are empty shells
2. **DON'T** assume services work - most return mock data
3. **DO** test every single integration point
4. **DO** add console.logs to verify data flow
5. **DO** check the actual database, not just the UI
6. **DO** run the app frequently to catch runtime errors
